# Vault: Oracle Cloud "Always Free" Deployment

Single instance running the full Vault stack via Docker Compose, on Oracle Cloud
Infrastructure's (OCI) permanent free tier. This is the free-forever sibling of
[`deploy/terraform`](../terraform/README.md) (the AWS EC2 version, ~$15/month).

This doc is written as a brief for another model or a person to turn into exact
click-by-click steps. It states facts and constraints (verified against Oracle's
docs, 2026-08-20); it does not assume the reader knows OCI's console layout.

---

## Why this costs $0, and how to keep it that way

- **The instance itself is free forever**, not a 12-month trial like AWS/GCP.
  Oracle's "Always Free" resources remain free for the life of the account, no
  expiration.
- **A new account starts in a 30-day/$300 trial.** During the trial, do not
  provision anything that is not explicitly labeled "Always Free" in the
  Console — trial resources are billed against the credit and are removed
  (not silently charged) once the trial ends, unless the account is manually
  upgraded.
- **The one hard rule: never click "Upgrade Account."** Oracle cannot charge
  the card on file unless the account is explicitly converted from
  Always-Free/Trial to Pay-As-You-Go. Sign-up puts a $1 authorization hold on
  the card for identity verification; Oracle reverses it immediately (the
  bank may take longer to reflect the reversal). That hold is the only
  contact this deployment ever makes with the card.
- **Set a spending budget as a tripwire anyway** (belt and suspenders): OCI
  Console -> Governance & Administration -> Cost Management -> Budgets ->
  create a budget of $1 with an alert at 0.01%. It can't prevent a charge
  since none can happen on an unupgraded account, but it emails a warning if
  anything unexpected shows up on the account.

## Resource budget (verified against `docs.oracle.com/iaas` on 2026-08-20)

Oracle cut the Ampere A1 Always Free allowance in half on 2026-06-15. Current limits:

| Resource | Always Free allowance |
|---|---|
| Ampere A1 compute (ARM, `VM.Standard.A1.Flex`) | 2 OCPU + 12 GB RAM total, pooled across the tenancy |
| AMD compute (`VM.Standard.E2.1.Micro`) | 2 instances, 1/8 OCPU + 1 GB RAM each — too small for this stack, ignore |
| Block storage | 200 GB total (boot + data volumes combined) |
| Outbound data transfer | 10 TB/month |
| Load balancer | 1 flexible LB, 10 Mbps — not needed, see "No TLS" below |

**Use one Ampere A1 instance sized 2 OCPU / 12 GB RAM.** That's the entire ARM
pool in a single box — don't split it into two smaller instances, this stack
needs it as one Docker Compose host. 12 GB is generous headroom for
Postgres + Redpanda + 4 Go services + Next.js + the Python `assist` service;
the boot volume (default 50 GB) leaves 150 GB of the storage pool unused.

## The two gotchas that aren't about money

1. **"Out of host capacity" on instance creation.** Ampere A1 Always Free
   capacity is oversubscribed in most regions and creation often fails on the
   first few tries. This is a known, widely-reported OCI issue, not a
   mistake in the steps. Retry across the different Availability Domains the
   Console offers, and retry at different times of day — it usually succeeds
   within a day of retries, sometimes on the first try.
2. **Idle-instance reclamation.** Oracle may reclaim (stop and delete) an
   Always Free compute instance if, over any 7-day window, its 95th-percentile
   CPU, network, *and* memory utilization all stay under 20%. A portfolio demo
   that sits untouched for a week risks this. It costs nothing to lose (the
   instance is free to recreate), but it does mean the demo link could go
   dark. Two options: check on it periodically yourself, or add a cron job
   that does a few minutes of trivial CPU work daily (`crontab -e` on the
   instance: `0 9 * * * timeout 300 yes > /dev/null`) to keep utilization
   readings above the floor. This is a widely used community workaround, not
   an Oracle-documented guarantee.

## No TLS, matching the AWS deploy

Like `deploy/terraform`, this is a demo-grade deploy: HTTP only, no reverse
proxy, no certificate. The web app is reached directly at
`http://<public-ip>:3001`. Skipped here on purpose to match the existing AWS
setup — add Caddy or the free OCI load balancer with a Let's Encrypt cert
later if the portfolio link needs to be `https://`.

## Steps

### 1. Create the account

Sign up at [oracle.com/cloud/free](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/). Requires
a credit card (identity verification only, see above) and, in some countries,
a phone number/ID. Pick a home region close to you — Always Free compute can
only be provisioned in the home region chosen at signup, it cannot be changed
later.

### 2. Create the compute instance

Console -> hamburger menu -> Compute -> Instances -> **Create Instance**.

- **Name:** `vault-server`
- **Image:** Canonical Ubuntu, latest 22.04 (or newer) **aarch64** build — the
  Console defaults to this once the shape below is picked. Do not pick a
  Marketplace image; only the plain platform image is guaranteed free.
- **Shape:** Change Shape -> Ampere -> `VM.Standard.A1.Flex` -> set
  **2 OCPUs / 12 GB memory**. The Console shows "Always Free eligible" next
  to the shape when the sliders are within budget — confirm that badge is
  present before continuing.
- **Networking:** let it create a new VCN (default settings are fine), keep
  "Assign a public IPv4 address" checked.
- **Add SSH keys:** upload a public key (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` or
  generate one with `ssh-keygen`) — needed to log in later.
- **Boot volume:** leave at the 50 GB default.
- **Advanced options -> Management -> Cloud-init script:** paste the full
  contents of [`cloud-init.sh`](cloud-init.sh) from this directory.

Click **Create**. If it fails with "Out of host capacity," see the gotcha
above and retry (change the Availability Domain shown in the shape config
before retrying).

### 3. Open the cloud-level firewall (Security List)

The instance's own iptables is opened by `cloud-init.sh`, but OCI has a
second firewall in front of it. Console -> Networking -> Virtual Cloud
Networks -> (the VCN just created) -> Security Lists -> Default Security
List -> **Add Ingress Rules**:

| Source CIDR | Protocol | Destination Port |
|---|---|---|
| `0.0.0.0/0` | TCP | 22 (usually already present) |
| `0.0.0.0/0` | TCP | 3001 |

Only 22 and 3001 are opened — `id`/`market`/`pay`/`assist` (8081-8084) and
Postgres/Redpanda (5432/9092) stay unreachable from the internet, same as the
AWS deploy.

### 4. Point the app at its public IP, then start it

`docker-compose.yml`'s `WEB_URL` (on `id`) and `WEB_ORIGIN` (on `web`) read
from a `${PUBLIC_HOST:-localhost}` variable — they're sent to the *browser*
for redirects and origin checks, so they must resolve to the instance's real
public IP, not `localhost`. Compose reads that variable from a `.env` file in
the project directory, which is why this is a manual step: OCI's instance
metadata service doesn't expose the public IP the way AWS's does (it's a
NAT'd address attached to the VNIC, not the instance), so `cloud-init.sh`
can't fill this in automatically.

Find the public IP on the instance's Console page, then:

```bash
ssh ubuntu@<public-ip>
cd ~/vault
echo "PUBLIC_HOST=<public-ip>" > .env
docker compose up -d
```

First run builds 5 images from source (Go x4, Python, Next.js) — several
minutes on a fresh instance. `docker compose ps` should show every service
healthy/running when done.

### 5. Verify

Open `http://<public-ip>:3001` in a browser. Confirm login/signup works end
to end (this exercises the `id` service's OIDC redirect through `WEB_URL`,
the part that breaks if step 4 was skipped).

## Teardown

Console -> Compute -> Instances -> `vault-server` -> **Terminate** (also tick
"Permanently delete the boot volume" to free the storage quota). No cost was
ever incurred, so there's nothing to "clean up" billing-wise — this just
reclaims the free-tier slot.

## Not included (intentionally, matches the AWS deploy's stance)

- TLS/HTTPS, custom domain
- Backups, multi-AZ, managed Postgres
- Secrets management (`.env` values are the same dev defaults as local)
- Terraform/IaC for OCI — this doc uses the Console + cloud-init directly
  because OCI's Terraform provider needs API signing keys and several OCIDs
  gathered by hand, which is more setup than a single free instance
  justifies. Worth doing later if the portfolio specifically wants
  Terraform-on-OCI as a talking point — ask if that's wanted.
