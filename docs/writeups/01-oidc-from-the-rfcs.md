# Building an OIDC provider from the RFCs (and what I got wrong first)

Most tutorials tell you to put an identity provider in front of your app and
never look inside. I did the opposite: for [Vault](https://github.com/NichoHo/vault),
a small marketplace, I built the OAuth 2.0 / OIDC provider myself — Authorization
Code + PKCE, RS256 with JWKS, TOTP MFA, and rotating refresh tokens with reuse
detection — reading the RFCs instead of reaching for a library. Not because you
*should* run a hand-rolled IdP in production (you shouldn't; the README says so
in bold), but because building one is the fastest way to understand the failure
modes the vetted libraries are quietly protecting you from.

This is a tour of the parts that were more subtle than they looked, and two
things I got wrong on the first pass.

## The authorization code must be single-use — and proving it is a race

The Authorization Code grant (RFC 6749 §4.1) is a two-step dance: the client
gets a short-lived `code` from the browser redirect, then exchanges it
server-to-server for tokens. The code is a bearer credential in a URL, so it
*will* leak into logs, referrer headers, and browser history. The whole design
rests on one rule: **a code is redeemable exactly once.** Redeem it, or see it
redeemed twice, and it's dead.

My first implementation read the code, checked `used_at IS NULL` in Go, then
issued tokens and set `used_at`. That's a classic time-of-check-to-time-of-use
race: two concurrent exchanges both read `NULL`, both pass the check, both mint
tokens. An attacker who captures a code races the legitimate client and wins a
token.

The fix is to make the check and the claim the same atomic operation, and let
the database arbitrate:

```go
// single atomic claim: a replayed code finds used_at already set and gets nothing
err := s.pool.QueryRow(r.Context(),
    `UPDATE id.auth_codes SET used_at = now()
     WHERE code = $1 AND used_at IS NULL
     RETURNING user_id, client_id, redirect_uri, scope, nonce, code_challenge, expires_at`,
    code).Scan(&userID, &clientID, &redirectURI, &scope, &nonce, &challenge, &expiresAt)
if errors.Is(err, pgx.ErrNoRows) {
    invalidGrant(w) // unknown OR already-used — indistinguishable, deliberately
    return
}
```

`UPDATE ... WHERE used_at IS NULL ... RETURNING` is a single statement. Exactly
one concurrent exchange gets the row back; every other gets `ErrNoRows` and a
generic `invalid_grant`. The database's row lock is the mutex I don't have to
write. The test that pins this replays a code and asserts the second exchange
gets 400 — and because I couldn't easily force a true concurrent race
deterministically, the atomic statement is what makes the sequential test
sufficient.

## PKCE, and refusing to be the downgrade

PKCE (RFC 7636) closes the code-interception gap for public clients: the client
sends `code_challenge = BASE64URL(SHA256(verifier))` up front, then proves it
holds the `verifier` at exchange time. The subtlety isn't computing the hash —
it's *refusing anything else*. If your `/authorize` accepts requests without a
challenge, or accepts `code_challenge_method=plain`, an attacker just omits PKCE
and you're back to bare OAuth. So the provider mandates S256:

```go
if q.Get("code_challenge_method") != "S256" || q.Get("code_challenge") == "" {
    httpx.Error(w, 400, "PKCE S256 code_challenge required")
    return
}
```

And the verifier check is a constant-time compare of the recomputed challenge —
not `==`, which leaks timing:

```go
sum := sha256.Sum256([]byte(r.PostForm.Get("code_verifier")))
if subtle.ConstantTimeCompare([]byte(b64(sum[:])), []byte(challenge)) != 1 {
    invalidGrant(w)
    return
}
```

The same "refuse the downgrade" instinct applies to the redirect URI. RFC 6749
§3.1.2.4 says compare it exactly against the registered value, and on mismatch
**do not redirect** — otherwise you're an open redirector. Exact string match,
error in place, no `Location` header.

## What I got wrong first: trusting the token's own `alg`

JWTs carry their signing algorithm in the header. The infamous mistake — the one
that's burned real systems — is verifying a token using the algorithm the token
*claims*. Accept `alg: none` and any unsigned token validates. Accept `alg: HS256`
against your RSA public key and an attacker signs tokens with your *public* key
as an HMAC secret.

My verifier hard-codes RS256 and rejects everything else before it even looks up
a key:

```go
if h.Alg != "RS256" {
    return c, fmt.Errorf("jwt: alg %q rejected", h.Alg)
}
pub, ok := keys[h.Kid]
if !ok {
    return c, fmt.Errorf("jwt: unknown kid %q", h.Kid)
}
```

The algorithm is the verifier's policy, never the token's suggestion. There's a
test that hands the verifier an `alg: none` token and asserts it's rejected, plus
one that tampers the payload and asserts the signature check catches it. Keys are
published at `/.well-known/jwks.json` and the resource services (market, pay)
fetch and cache them, refetching on an unknown `kid` — which is also how key
rotation propagates without downtime.

## Refresh token rotation, and treating reuse as theft

Access tokens are short-lived (15 minutes); refresh tokens are the long-lived
credential, so they get the most careful handling (RFC 6819 §5.2.2.3). Vault
*rotates* them: every refresh returns a new refresh token and marks the old one
used. A refresh token belongs to a **family** — the chain of rotations from one
original grant.

The security property comes from what happens on reuse. If a refresh token that
has already been rotated away is presented again, that means one of two things:
the legitimate client double-submitted, or a token was stolen and now two parties
hold the same chain. You can't tell which, so you assume the worst and revoke the
entire family:

```go
if usedAt != nil {
    // reuse detected — burn the whole family
    s.pool.Exec(r.Context(),
        `UPDATE id.refresh_tokens SET revoked_at = now()
         WHERE family_id = $1 AND revoked_at IS NULL`, familyID)
    s.audit(r.Context(), userID, "refresh.reuse_detected",
        map[string]any{"family": familyID, "client": clientID})
    invalidGrant(w)
    return
}
```

The test seeds a rotation chain, rotates twice, then re-presents the
*already-rotated* token and asserts that not only it but the newest live token in
the family is now dead — a stolen token can't outlive detection, and the real
user is forced to re-authenticate rather than silently sharing a session with an
attacker. Rotation itself is another atomic `UPDATE ... WHERE used_at IS NULL`,
same pattern as the auth code.

## MFA from the HMAC up

TOTP (RFC 6238 over RFC 4226) is just HMAC-SHA1 of a 30-second counter, truncated
to six digits. Building it from the primitive — rather than a library — meant I
could test it against the RFC's published vectors, which is the kind of check
that actually catches a bug:

```go
func hotp(key []byte, counter uint64) string {
    var msg [8]byte
    binary.BigEndian.PutUint64(msg[:], counter)
    mac := hmac.New(sha1.New, key)
    mac.Write(msg[:])
    sum := mac.Sum(nil)
    offset := sum[len(sum)-1] & 0x0f
    code := binary.BigEndian.Uint32(sum[offset:offset+4]) & 0x7fffffff
    return fmt.Sprintf("%06d", code%1_000_000)
}
```

Verification accepts the current step plus one either side (clock skew) and
compares in constant time; recovery codes are single-use, burned with — you
guessed it — a guarded `UPDATE`.

## What building it taught me

Three patterns recur through the whole provider: **let the database enforce
single-use** (guarded `UPDATE ... RETURNING` instead of check-then-write),
**make the server the policy authority** (mandate S256, hard-code RS256 —
never inherit a security decision from attacker-controlled input), and **treat
ambiguous security events as attacks** (refresh reuse revokes the family). None
of these are exotic. They're exactly what the vetted libraries do — and the
value of building the provider from the RFCs was ending up unable to *un*-see
why. In production I'd still reach for the vetted library. But now I know what
it's protecting me from.

*Vault's identity provider is [`internal/id`](../../internal/id/); the misuse
tests — replayed codes, wrong verifier, `alg:none`, refresh reuse — are the
loudest signal in the repo.*
